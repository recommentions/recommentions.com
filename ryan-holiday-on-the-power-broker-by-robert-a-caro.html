The Power Broker by Robert Caro, 48 Laws of Power, The Black Swan, life is unpredictable. Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s Fight
Club. Four Hour Work Week - Huge! 33 Strategies of War, obviously Robert Greene&#x27;s Mastery. Pia Mellody, one of my
favorite authors [Facing Codependence]. This biography of John D Rockefeller, maybe you remember it from The Obstacle is the way? This book by John Boyd [...] Malcolm X the autobiography, Great Gatsby, What Makes Sammy Run. A friend of mine recommended this biography William Lee Miller on President Lincoln. It was one of the books that changed his life. Had totally changed how I thought about leadership. The War of Art, Turning Pro -  two
favorites from Steven Pressfield. Haruki Murakami&#x27;s book on running &#x27;What I talk about when I talk about running&#x27;.
Ellison&#x27;s Invisible Man. Again another book from Pia Mellody [Facing Love Addiction]. Cheryl Strayed&#x27;s Tiny Beautiful Things. Thích Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s Taming the Tiger Within. The Brass Check - this book inspired the name of my marketing company and my book Trust Me I&#x27;m Lying. This is one of my copies of Meditations. Why Don&#x27;t We
Learn From History by BH Liddell Hart. Prescription For Adversity, a strange book biography of Ambrose Bierce that I like. Candide, interesting story I stole this from where I got married they had this on the shelf. I read it while I was waiting for my wife to get ready to get married and I thought hey I&#x27;m keeping this. [...] Second Mountain, this is a new addition to the shelf. Dr. Drew [The Mirror Effect] who introduced me to stoicism, Great! This is a cool book -Lincoln: the Biography of a Writer it&#x27;s an analysis of Lincoln as if he was a writer. This book: Strategy by BH Liddell Hart influenced how I think about strategy.John Graves Hard Scrabble, influenced how I think about my farm. Fishing For Fun is a new book, I just read by Herbert Hoover about the philosophical benefits of fishing and yes Herbert Hoover, the president. Chesterfield&#x27;s letters to his son [...] Seth Godin&#x27;s the Dip, great book. Neil Postman&#x27;s Amusing Ourselves To Death. Jane Jacobs also amazing. Daniel Boorstin, great. Death Be Not Proud, beautiful book. So these are some of the books, it&#x27;s my life shelf.  [...] Oh Austin Kleon&#x27;s Steal Like An Artist, great! The Way To Love by Anthony De Mello.

I think it&#x27;s complicated. If you read the new Chernow book he paints a nuanced picture of Grant&#x27;s presidency that I found quite compelling. At the same time, it&#x27;s clear Grant did not do the work on himself required to be a great President. Eisenhower made the transition from soldier to statesman. Grant didn&#x27;t quite get there. Ego had something to do with it. Naïveté did as well. [...]

Very tough. I think Manchester and Caro are tied. Chernow is third. The first two are more poetic and beautiful in their prose. They seem to really get inside the skin of their subjects.</blockquote><p><small>2019-10-29 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/doshqb/im_ryan_holiday_author_whose_books_brought/f5r1wgz/?context=3">www.reddit.com</a></small></p></li></ol></div><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><script src="script.js"></script></body></html><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-BL1QJBLNM1"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}gtag('js',new Date());gtag('config','G-BL1QJBLNM1');</script>
