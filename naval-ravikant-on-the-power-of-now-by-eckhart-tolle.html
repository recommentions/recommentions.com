When I first read him in my late thirties, it was like a bomb went off in my head. He was speaking in a language that was completely removed from my own. He wrote in a very complex form of English where he used certain words in a way that didn&#x27;t line up with what I had learned over my entire life. 

But it had the feel of truth to it. He laid out a clear, consistent, and integrated philosophy of what it means to be conscious and free. That said, it&#x27;s a very advanced read. I&#x27;ve given Krishnamurti to some of my friends and they just hand it back and tell me that it didn&#x27;t make any sense to them. I think it&#x27;s better to start with something simpler like Eckart Tolle, Adyashanti, Jed McKenna, or Osho. </blockquote><p><small>2016-10-17 on <a href="http://www.killingbuddha.co/blog/2016/9/19/naval-ravikant-on-travelling-lightly" target="_blank">www.killingbuddha.co</a></small></p></li><li><blockquote>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blusoup?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@blusoup&lt;/a&gt; Start with &quot;The Power of Now&quot; if you haven&#x27;t read it yet.
