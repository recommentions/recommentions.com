I think they were like $1.99 or $2.99 each? Anyway, I read basically the whole series book by book as a kid and it was an amazing introduction not just to reading but to really good stories and books. Robinson Crusoe. The Jungle Book. Tale of Two Cities. Huckleberry Finn. It was great. It was only later that I realized just how edited and different the books actually were. For instance, Tale of Two Cities does NOT begin with &quot;It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.&quot; But anyway, I just bought the whole set for my newborn on eBay and am already starting again.</blockquote><p><small>2017-08-16 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6u2e70/i_am_ryan_holiday_author_of_perennial_seller_the/dlpdgvu/?context=3" target="_blank">www.reddit.com</a></small></p></li></ol></div><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><script src="script.js"></script></body></html><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-BL1QJBLNM1"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}gtag('js',new Date());gtag('config','G-BL1QJBLNM1');</script>
