Sinclair, PhD, is a professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging. He is the co-founder of the journal Aging, where he serves as co-chief editor.

Dr. Sinclair&#x27;s work focuses on understanding the mechanisms that drive human aging and identifying ways to slow or reverse aging&#x27;s effects. In particular, he has examined the role of sirtuins in disease and aging, with special emphasis on how sirtuin activity is modulated by compounds produced by the body as well as those consumed in the diet, such as resveratrol. His work has implications for human metabolism, mitochondrial and neurological health, and cancer.

Dr. Sinclair obtained his doctoral degree in molecular genetics at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, in 1995. Since then, he has been the recipient of more than 25 prestigious honors and awards and in 2014 was named as one of TIME Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world. Dr. Sinclair recently authored the book Lifespan: Why We Age – and Why We Don&#x27;t Have To.

Aging – a process that began the moment we were born – is generally thought of as inevitable. Although aging isn&#x27;t a disease, it is the primary risk factor for developing many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and cancer. In turn, many of these conditions hasten the aging process, setting up a vicious cycle of cellular damage and systemic loss of function. A growing field of research, led by a few innovative scientists proposing radical, contrarian ideas, suggests that aging might not be as inevitable as once thought.

In this episode, Dr. David Sinclair discusses exciting new findings in the field of aging research, with special emphasis on the roles of sirtuins, resveratrol, and NAD+.</blockquote><p><a href="lifespan-by-david-sinclair/"><small>View all 3 sources</small></a></p></div></li><li id="true-age-cutting-edge-research-to-help-turn-back-the-clock-by-morgan-levine"><div class="flex-side"><a href="true-age-by-morgan-levine/" class="mentions-count"><span>2</span><br/>mentions</a><figure><img src="../../open-covers/isbn-0593542762.webp" alt="True Age: Cutting-Edge Research to Help Turn Back the Clock by Morgan Levine" height="300" loading="lazy"/></figure></div><div class="flex-main"><p style="margin-top:0;font-size:1.2em" class="title"><a href="/books/true-age-by-morgan-levine/"><em>True Age: Cutting-Edge Research to Help Turn Back the Clock</em></a><br/><small> by Morgan Levine</small></p><blockquote class="curly-quote" data-fade="false" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Congratulations, @DrMorganLevine!

The book effectively put vitamin C on the nutritional map, establishing it as a cure-all in the collective minds of the lay public. Nearly a decade later, Pauling published clinical data suggesting that high dose intravenous administration of vitamin C showed promise as a supportive treatment for cancer as well as a strategy to mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy. Pauling&#x27;s work was heavily criticized in the scientific community, however, due to a lack of proper controls and standardization. Since then, countless studies have tested Pauling&#x27;s theories about vitamin C, colds, and cancer (and many others), and a substantial body of evidence has emerged, identifying critical roles for vitamin C in immune function, cardiovascular and respiratory health, cognitive development and preservation, and many other aspects of human health.</blockquote><p><a href="vitamin-c-and-the-common-cold-by-linus-pauling/"><small>View source</small></a></p></div></li><li id="the-longevity-diet-by-valter-longo"><div class="flex-side"><a href="the-longevity-diet-by-valter-longo/" class="mentions-count"><span>1</span><br/>mention</a><figure><img src="../../open-covers/13179364.webp" alt="The Longevity Diet by Valter Longo" height="300" loading="lazy"/></figure></div><div class="flex-main"><p style="margin-top:0;font-size:1.2em" class="title"><a href="/books/the-longevity-diet-by-valter-longo/"><em>The Longevity Diet</em></a><br/><small> by Valter Longo</small></p><blockquote class="curly-quote" data-fade="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap">To establish an optimal diet for longevity, scientists are pursuing various avenues of investigation, including basic and clinical research as well as epidemiological and centenarian studies.

In Dr. Raison’s randomized, double-blind study published in JAMA in 2016, it was shown that a single session of whole-body hyperthermia (core body temperature was elevated to 38.5 C) produced a significant antidepressant effect in people with major depressive disorder compared to those who received a sham control. The improvements were apparent within a week of treatment and persisted for six weeks after treatment.

But what is responsible for this antidepressant effect? In a previous episode of the podcast, we learned that sauna use seems to share many qualities of exercise, including improvements in arterial compliance, elevations in heart rate that reach levels you might see in aerobic exercise. Moreover, sauna use has been shown to be associated with reductions in heart-related mortality, dementia and more.

The race is divided into three stages over three days: The first is a 6.2 mile (10-km) ocean swim, followed by a 90-mile (145-km) cross-country bike ride, with vertical climbs that total 6,000 feet. Stage two is a 171.4-mile (276-km) bike ride, with total vertical climbs of 4,000 feet. Finally, stage three is a 52.4-mile (84-km) double marathon. Each stage must be completed within 12 hours or less.
