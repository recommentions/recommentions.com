It&#x27;s a Japanese writer who spent some time in England and then he came back and then he published this in a magazine only I think the first chapter he wasn&#x27;t planning to make it into this beast that it is today but people liked it so much that he kept publishing it and uh yeah maybe that&#x27;s how you were supposed to read it just like in parts here and there. [...] This book is a satire, it&#x27;s a very old satire but that doesn&#x27;t stop it from being enjoyable, just like Don Quijote or
any other book that is well written.</blockquote><details><summary><small>2022-03-12 on <u>www.youtube.com</u></small></summary><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JpnDfDPinPk?feature=oembed&amp;start=0" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe></details></li></ol></div><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><script src="script.js"></script></body></html><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-BL1QJBLNM1"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}gtag('js',new Date());gtag('config','G-BL1QJBLNM1');</script>
