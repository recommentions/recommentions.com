appreciate what Ed has tried to do with this book, and I&#x27;m a fan of his and Pixar. It was an enjoyable read, but if I was to complain about something it&#x27;s that I felt the book was trying to be contrarian quite often in a slightly forced way. I ended up noticing a formula repeated many times:
In this situation most people would think X... (I didn&#x27;t, and I wasn&#x27;t fully sold that most would), 
but I think Y (I agree and I&#x27;ve heard something similar said several times before).
Of course, there was a distribution of reactions to these statements - some I thought were relatively unique and interesting (e.g. negative spaces in art, a well-articulated defense of errors), and some were somewhat forceful (e.g. do not resist change - okay, thanks). I could also notice a persistent undertone of pride for Pixar employees, with statements such as &quot;Do you see now why I love to work here?&quot;. Somehow I have slight negative reaction to it. I understand he&#x27;s very excited and Pixar is his baby, but for me these parts started to feel like PR.
There were a few things like this that slightly rubbed me the wrong way as I read through it, but I don&#x27;t mean to sound too negative and overall enjoyed several interesting parts, Ed&#x27;s quite obvious desire to understand these topics as well as he can is fun and contagious. I liked the chapter on the Notes day near the end, that sounds like a quite nice idea that I also see a lot of merit in - the idea of recognizing that your employees have brains, and distributing decision making through the ensemble of smart people throughout the company to some degree, and giving them a sense of ownership. A powerful strategy, and this was well articulated. Also, I liked the reflections on Steve Jobs, and the dispelled myths about his personality. I do notice quite consistently that people who knew him best cringe the most when they are asked about popular media coverage about his life.
Somewhere between 3 (I liked it) and 4 (I really liked it) /5. I&#x27;ll round up because it&#x27;s Ed. 4/5</blockquote><p><small>2015-12-02 on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1413294994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">goodreads.com</a></small></p></li></ol></div><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><script>window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;ga('create', 'UA-229625159-1', 'auto');ga('send', 'pageview');</script><script async="" src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script></body></html>
