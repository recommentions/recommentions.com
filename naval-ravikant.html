I read him in my late thirties; changed my life. You know sometimes you’re just not ready for the book, or the book is a conversation between the reader and the author and ... one party isn’t ready.

When I first read him in my late thirties, it was like a bomb went off in my head. He was speaking in a language that was completely removed from my own. He wrote in a very complex form of English where he used certain words in a way that didn&#x27;t line up with what I had learned over my entire life. 

But it had the feel of truth to it. He laid out a clear, consistent, and integrated philosophy of what it means to be conscious and free. That said, it&#x27;s a very advanced read. I&#x27;ve given Krishnamurti to some of my friends and they just hand it back and tell me that it didn&#x27;t make any sense to them.

When I first read him in my late thirties, it was like a bomb went off in my head. He was speaking in a language that was completely removed from my own. He wrote in a very complex form of English where he used certain words in a way that didn&#x27;t line up with what I had learned over my entire life. 

But it had the feel of truth to it. He laid out a clear, consistent, and integrated philosophy of what it means to be conscious and free. That said, it&#x27;s a very advanced read. I&#x27;ve given Krishnamurti to some of my friends and they just hand it back and tell me that it didn&#x27;t make any sense to them.

That made a lot of money, so can you please crank out a second book right away?” So they come up with one in a year or two and call it Homo Deus. Homo Deus is very insightful and very clever and very smart, but it’s basically got one big idea at the center. When you figure out that one idea, you don’t need to finish the whole book. Whereas with Sapiens, there’s lots and lots of great ideas in there and it’s just full of them, chock full per page.

But it had the feel of truth to it. He laid out a clear, consistent, and integrated philosophy of what it means to be conscious and free. That said, it&#x27;s a very advanced read.

One is when I grew up, I wanted to be a physicist and I idolized Richard Feynman and I read everything by him, technical and nontechnical that I could get my hands on. He said: you must never, ever fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.
So the physics grounding is very important because in physics, you have to speak truth. You don’t compromise. You don’t negotiate with people. You don’t try and make them feel better because if your equation is wrong, it just won’t work, whatever you’re doing. So I think the science background is important in that.

They’re just sort of you can look back after the fact and say oh yeah, I won’t compromise on those things. But now I realize how important honesty is. I learned that from a couple of different places. One is when I grew up, I wanted to be a physicist and I idolized Richard Feynman and I read everything by him, technical and nontechnical that I could get my hands on. He said: you must never, ever fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.
So the physics grounding is very important because in physics, you have to speak truth. You don’t compromise. You don’t negotiate with people. You don’t try and make them feel better because if your equation is wrong, it just won’t work, whatever you’re doing. So I think the science background is important in that.

When I first read him in my late thirties, it was like a bomb went off in my head. He was speaking in a language that was completely removed from my own. He wrote in a very complex form of English where he used certain words in a way that didn&#x27;t line up with what I had learned over my entire life. 

But it had the feel of truth to it. He laid out a clear, consistent, and integrated philosophy of what it means to be conscious and free. That said, it&#x27;s a very advanced read. I&#x27;ve given Krishnamurti to some of my friends and they just hand it back and tell me that it didn&#x27;t make any sense to them.

When I first read him in my late thirties, it was like a bomb went off in my head. He was speaking in a language that was completely removed from my own. He wrote in a very complex form of English where he used certain words in a way that didn&#x27;t line up with what I had learned over my entire life. 

But it had the feel of truth to it. He laid out a clear, consistent, and integrated philosophy of what it means to be conscious and free. That said, it&#x27;s a very advanced read. I&#x27;ve given Krishnamurti to some of my friends and they just hand it back and tell me that it didn&#x27;t make any sense to them. I think it&#x27;s better to start with something simpler like Eckart Tolle, Adyashanti, Jed McKenna, or Osho. </blockquote><details><summary><small>Sources</small></summary><ol><li><blockquote>Krishnamurti was incredibly influential on me.

Up there with the Bhagavad-gita, the Tao Te Ching, The Bible, The Qur’an. It was written in that style where it had that feel of religiosity and truth, but it was very approachable and beautiful and non-denominational and non-secretarian. I really liked that. I loved that book.

He has a gift for poetically describing what children are like, what lovers are like, what marriage should be like, how you should treat your enemies and your friends, how you should work with money, what can you think of every time you have to kill something to eat it. I felt, like the great religious books, it gave a very deep, very philosophical, but very true answer to how to approach the major problems in life. I recommend the prophet to anybody, whether you’re religious or not. Whether you are Christian or Hindu or Jewish or Atheist. I think it’s a beautiful book, and it’s worth reading. Thank you to whoever recommended that one.
