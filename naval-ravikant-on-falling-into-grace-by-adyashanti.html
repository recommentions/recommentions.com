When I first read him in my late thirties, it was like a bomb went off in my head. He was speaking in a language that was completely removed from my own. He wrote in a very complex form of English where he used certain words in a way that didn&#x27;t line up with what I had learned over my entire life. 

But it had the feel of truth to it. He laid out a clear, consistent, and integrated philosophy of what it means to be conscious and free. That said, it&#x27;s a very advanced read. I&#x27;ve given Krishnamurti to some of my friends and they just hand it back and tell me that it didn&#x27;t make any sense to them. I think it&#x27;s better to start with something simpler like Eckart Tolle, Adyashanti, Jed McKenna, or Osho. </blockquote><p><small>2016-10-17 on <a href="http://www.killingbuddha.co/blog/2016/9/19/naval-ravikant-on-travelling-lightly">www.killingbuddha.co</a></small></p></li><li><blockquote>I thought [it] was very good.</blockquote><p><small>2016-01-30 on <a href="https://tim.blog/2016/01/30/naval-ravikant-on-happiness-hacks/">tim.blog</a></small></p></li></ol></div><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><script src="script.js"></script></body></html><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-BL1QJBLNM1"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}gtag('js',new Date());gtag('config','G-BL1QJBLNM1');</script>
