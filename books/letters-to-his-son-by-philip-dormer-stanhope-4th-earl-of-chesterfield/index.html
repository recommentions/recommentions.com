Club. Four Hour Work Week - Huge! 33 Strategies of War, obviously Robert Greene&#x27;s Mastery. Pia Mellody, one of my
favorite authors [Facing Codependence]. This biography of John D Rockefeller, maybe you remember it from The Obstacle is the way? This book by John Boyd [...] Malcolm X the autobiography, Great Gatsby, What Makes Sammy Run. A friend of mine recommended this biography William Lee Miller on President Lincoln. It was one of the books that changed his life. Had totally changed how I thought about leadership. The War of Art, Turning Pro -  two
favorites from Steven Pressfield. Haruki Murakami&#x27;s book on running &#x27;What I talk about when I talk about running&#x27;.
Ellison&#x27;s Invisible Man. Again another book from Pia Mellody [Facing Love Addiction]. Cheryl Strayed&#x27;s Tiny Beautiful Things. Thích Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s Taming the Tiger Within. The Brass Check - this book inspired the name of my marketing company and my book Trust Me I&#x27;m Lying. This is one of my copies of Meditations. Why Don&#x27;t We
Learn From History by BH Liddell Hart. Prescription For Adversity, a strange book biography of Ambrose Bierce that I like. Candide, interesting story I stole this from where I got married they had this on the shelf. I read it while I was waiting for my wife to get ready to get married and I thought hey I&#x27;m keeping this. [...] Second Mountain, this is a new addition to the shelf. Dr. Drew [The Mirror Effect] who introduced me to stoicism, Great! This is a cool book -Lincoln: the Biography of a Writer it&#x27;s an analysis of Lincoln as if he was a writer. This book: Strategy by BH Liddell Hart influenced how I think about strategy.John Graves Hard Scrabble, influenced how I think about my farm. Fishing For Fun is a new book, I just read by Herbert Hoover about the philosophical benefits of fishing and yes Herbert Hoover, the president. Chesterfield&#x27;s letters to his son [...] Seth Godin&#x27;s the Dip, great book. Neil Postman&#x27;s Amusing Ourselves To Death. Jane Jacobs also amazing. Daniel Boorstin, great.
