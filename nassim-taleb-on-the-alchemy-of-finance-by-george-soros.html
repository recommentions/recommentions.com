First, although I admire him greatly, I agree with professional thinkers that Soros’ forte is not in philosophical speculation. Yet he considers himself a philosopher—which makes him endearing in more than one way. Take his first book, The Alchemy of Finance. On the one hand, he seems to discuss ideas of scientific explanation by throwing in big names like “deductive-nomological,” something always suspicious as it is reminiscent of postmodern writers who play philosophers and scientists by using complicated references. On the other hand, he does not show much grasp of the concepts.</blockquote><p><small>2001 on <a href="Fooled By Randomness" target="_blank"></a></small></p></li></ol></div><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><script src="script.js"></script></body></html><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-BL1QJBLNM1"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}gtag('js',new Date());gtag('config','G-BL1QJBLNM1');</script>
