I’ve turned to him for articles and books and casual dinner conversation. The one pristine white cover is now its own shade of tan, but with every read, every time I’ve touched the book, I’ve gotten something new or been reminded of something timeless and important.</blockquote><a href="ryan-holiday-on-meditations-by-marcus-aurelius.html" class="action"><small>View all 52 sources</small></a></div></li><li><div class="flex-side"><div class="mentions-count"><span>12</span><br/>mentions</div><figure><img src="open-covers/11416998.jpg" alt="The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene" height="300" loading="lazy"/></figure></div><div class="flex-main"><p style="margin-top:0;font-size:1.2em" class="title"><em>The 48 Laws of Power</em><br/><small> by Robert Greene</small></p><blockquote class="curly-quote" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Ooh the GOAT Robert Greene, the 48 Laws of Power.
