Didn&#x27;t know much about this author when I read him, which I think added to the effect for me so I almost don&#x27;t want to talk about him because discovering him was equally as fun almost or really added to the experience for me. [...] When I read &#x27;The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea&quot; I just felt so completely immersed into the main character&#x27;s mind which is something I never really experienced before with literature. </blockquote><p><small>2018-12-29 on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNar3Dh9zDk&amp;list=PLpe2ydPC0gcd3qoLRvZik5mjXuLcTj0Qs&amp;index=8">www.youtube.com</a></small></p><details><summary><small>Watch on YouTube</small></summary><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNar3Dh9zDk?feature=oembed&amp;start=0" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe></details></li><li><blockquote>So I uh randomly picked Yukio Mishima&#x27;s &quot;The Sailor who Fell from Grace with the Sea&quot; and I was so en... what&#x27;s the right word?
